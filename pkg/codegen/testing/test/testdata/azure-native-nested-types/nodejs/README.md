The native Azure provider package offers support for all Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
resources and their properties. Resources are exposed as types from modules based on Azure Resource
Providers such as 'compute', 'network', 'storage', and 'web', among many others. Using this package
allows you to programmatically declare instances of any Azure resource and any supported resource
version using infrastructure as code, which Pulumi then uses to drive the ARM API.
