// Provider presents a simple interface for orchestrating resource create, reead, update, and delete operations.  Each
// provider understands how to handle all of the resource types within a single package.
//
// This interface hides some of the messiness of the underlying machinery, since providers are behind an RPC boundary.
//
// It is important to note that provider operations are not transactional.  (Some providers might decide to offer
// transactional semantics, but such a provider is a rare treat.)  As a result, failures in the operations below can
// range from benign to catastrophic (possibly leaving behind a corrupt resource).  It is up to the provider to make a
// best effort to ensure catastrophes do not occur.  The errors returned from mutating operations indicate both the
// underlying error condition in addition to a bit indicating whether the operation was successfully rolled back.
