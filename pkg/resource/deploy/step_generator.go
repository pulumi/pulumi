//
// In lieu of tracking per-step dependencies and orienting the step executor around these dependencies, this function
// provides a conservative approximation of what deletions can safely occur in parallel. The insight here is that the
// resource dependency graph is a partially-ordered set and all partially-ordered sets can be easily decomposed into
// antichains - subsets of the set that are all not comparable to one another. (In this definition, "not comparable"
// means "do not depend on one another").
//
// The algorithm for decomposing a poset into antichains is:
//  1. While there exist elements in the poset,
//     1a. There must exist at least one "maximal" element of the poset. Let E_max be those elements.
//     2a. Remove all elements E_max from the poset. E_max is an antichain.

//  1. While the set of condemned resources is not empty:
//     1a. Remove all resources with no outgoing edges from the graph and add them to the current antichain.
//     2a. Goto 1.
//
// The resulting list of antichains is a list of list of steps that can be safely executed in parallel. Since we must

	// to their dependencies. We determine whether or not a resource may be replaced by substituting
	// unknowns for input properties that may change due to deletion of the resources their value
	// depends on and calling the resource provider's `Diff` method.
	//
	// This is perhaps clearer when described by example. Consider the following dependency graph:
	//
	//       A
	//     __|__
	//     B   C
	//     |  _|_
	//     D  E F

	// however, that changes to the specific properties of any of those resources R that would occur
	// if a resource on the path to A were deleted and recreated may not cause R to be replaced. For
	// example, the edge from B to A may be a simple `dependsOn` edge such that a change to B does
	// not actually influence any of B's input properties.  More commonly, the edge from B to A may
	// be due to a property from A being used as the input to a property of B that does not require
	// B to be replaced upon a change. In these cases, neither B nor D would need to be deleted
	// before A could be deleted.
