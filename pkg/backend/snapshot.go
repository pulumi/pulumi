// the last persisted snapshot in `BeginSnapshot`. This is designed to match existing behavior and will not
// be the state of things going forward.

	//
	// - Begin with an empty merged DAG.
	// - For each resource r in the current DAG, insert r and its outgoing edges into the merged DAG.
	// - For each resource r in the base DAG:
	//     - If r is in the merged DAG, we are done: if the resource is in the merged DAG, it must have been in the

	//     - If r is not in the merged DAG, insert it and its outgoing edges into the merged DAG.

	// Physically, however, each DAG is represented as list of resources without explicit dependency edges. In place of
	// edges, it is assumed that the list represents a valid topological sort of its source DAG. Thus, any resource r at
	// index i in a list L must be assumed to be dependent on all resources in L with index j s.t. j < i. Due to this

	//
	// - Begin with an empty merged list.
	// - For each resource r in the current list, append r to the merged list. r must be in a correct location in the
	//   merged list, as its position relative to its assumed dependencies has not changed.
	// - For each resource r in the base list:
	//     - If r is in the merged list, we are done by the logic given in the original algorithm.
	//     - If r is not in the merged list, append r to the merged list. r must be in a correct location in the merged
	//       list:
	//         - If any of r's dependencies were in the current list, they must already be in the merged list and their
	//           relative order w.r.t. r has not changed.
	//         - If any of r's dependencies were not in the current list, they must already be in the merged list, as
