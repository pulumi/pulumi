	// BeginMutation and SnapshotMutation.End allow a snapshot provider to be robust in the face of failures that occur
	// between the points at which they are called. The semantics are as follows:
	//     1. The engine calls `SnapshotProvider.Begin` to indicate that it is about to mutate the state of the
	//        resources tracked by the snapshot.
	//     2. The engine mutates the state of the resoures tracked by the snapshot.
	//     3. The engine calls `SnapshotMutation.End` with the new snapshot to indicate that the mutation(s) it was
	//        performing has/have finished.
	// During (1), the snapshot provider should record the fact that any currently persisted snapshot is being mutated
	// and cannot be assumed to represent the actual state of the system. This ensures that if the engine crashes during
	// (2), then the current snapshot is known to be unreliable. During (3), the snapshot provider should persist the
	// provided snapshot and record that it is known to be reliable.
