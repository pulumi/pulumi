    Add stack tags support for DIY backends (S3, Postgres, file-based, etc.).
    
    DIY backends now support stack tags functionality, bringing feature parity with cloud backends.
    This includes:
    
    - Full CRUD operations for stack tags (create, read, update, delete)
    - Automatic system tag injection (e.g., `pulumi:project`)
    - Tag filtering support in stack listing operations
    - Backward compatibility with existing stacks (no tags file required)
    - Atomic operations with caching for performance
    - Automatic cleanup of tag files when stacks are deleted
    
    Tags are stored as separate `.pulumi-tags` files alongside stack checkpoints, using a versioned
    JSON format. The implementation works across all DIY backend storage types including S3, Azure Blob,
    Google Cloud Storage, PostgreSQL, and local file systems.
    
    Example usage:
    ```bash
    pulumi stack tag set environment production
    pulumi stack tag set owner backend-team
    pulumi stack ls --tag-filter environment=production
    ```
