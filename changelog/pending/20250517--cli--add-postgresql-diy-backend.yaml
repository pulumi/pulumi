    Add PostgreSQL support as a backend for Pulumi. 
    Users can now store Pulumi state in a PostgreSQL database using the `postgres://` URL scheme.
    Example: `pulumi login postgres://username:password@hostname:5432/database`
    
    The PostgreSQL backend uses a single table to store all state information, with automatic table
    creation during initialization. The backend supports all standard Pulumi operations and provides
    the same capabilities as other DIY backends.
