    Adds `pulumi org search` and `pulumi org search ai` for Pulumi Insights in the CLI. These commands render a table containing all resources in a given organization matching the query provided.

      `-q <query>` will search for resources in the organization using a query provided in Pulumi Query Syntax.

      `-o <json|csv|yaml>` flag customizes the output.

      The `ai` command uses AI Assist to translate a natural language query into Pulumi Query Syntax.

      Default table output will show a count of displayed resources out of the total. Additional output includes the query run, a URL to view and explore search results in the Pulumi Console and the query, and the query run.

      Additional output is suppressed for non-table output formats such that they can be easily piped into other tools.

      The `--web` flag will open the search results in a default browser.

    Adds `pulumi ai` command - currently the only functionality in this group is `pulumi ai web`, which will open the Pulumi AI application in a default browser. An optional `--prompt/-p` flag can be provided with a query to pre-populate the search bar in the Pulumi AI application. By default, that prompt will be submitted automatically, but passing `--no-auto-submit` will prevent that.
