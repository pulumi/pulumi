    Adds `pulumi org search` and `pulumi org search ai` for Pulumi Insights in the CLI.
    These commands render a table containing all resources in a given organization matching the
    query provided.

      The `-o <json|csv|yaml>` flag customizes the output.

      `pulumi org search -q <query>` will search for resources in the organization using
    a query provided in Pulumi Query Syntax. 
    
      `pulumi org search ai -q <query>` will translate a plaintext query into Pulumi Query Syntax
    and then search for resources in the organization using that query.

      Default table output will show a count of displayed resources out of the total. Additional
    output includes the query run, a URL to view and explore search results in the Pulumi Console
    and the query, and the query run.

      Additional output is suppressed for non-table output formats such that they can be
    easily piped into other tools.

      The `--web` flag will open the search results in a default browser.

    Adds `pulumi ai` command - currently the only functionality in this group is `pulumi ai web`, which will
    open the Pulumi AI application in a default browser. An optional `--prompt/-p` flag can be provided with
    a query to pre-populate the search bar in the Pulumi AI application. By default, that prompt will be submitted
    automatically, but passing `--no-auto-submit` will prevent that.
