  Adds pulumi new --ai functionality.
  The `pulumi new` command now defaults to a new experience - users can select `ai` or `template` if no arguments are specified.

  If `ai` is selected, we offer a guided experience to iteratively prompt Pulumi AI to craft a program for you.

  Additionally, for a less interactive experience, we offer the flags `--ai` and `--language`. If `--ai <prompt>` is provided,
  we will begin the interactive prompting session with the provided prompt. If `--language <language>` is provided with a supported language,
  we will skip the language selection prompt and begin the interactive prompting session with the provided language. Addionally, if `--yes` is provided,
  we will skip the verification step and immediately create the project generated by the given prompt and language.
