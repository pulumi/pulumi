    Fix `pulumi stack select` unnecessarily fetching stack metadata.
    
    The `pulumi stack select` command now only fetches stack names instead of complete metadata,
    since the selection UI only displays stack names. This significantly improves performance,
    especially for DIY backends where metadata fetching can be slow.
    
    Previously, the command was fetching the same metadata as `pulumi stack ls` (last update time,
    resource count, etc.) but never displaying this information to the user, causing unnecessary
    delays during stack selection.
