pulumi_tls==4.10.0

# TODO[pulumi/pulumi#12414]: Remove our implicit dependency on setuptools.
# Python 3.12 doesn't include setuptools in virtual environments created by
# `python -m venv`, so we need to add it to the requirements file here.
# Otherwise, on Python 3.12, when running this test we'll get an error from
# the generated example library's _utilities.py file:
#     ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pkg_resources'
