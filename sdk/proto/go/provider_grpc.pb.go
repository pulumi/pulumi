	// behaviour at a high level (e.g. by specifying the region in which an AWS provider should operate), a
	// `Parameterize` call may change the set of resources and functions that a provider offers (that is, its schema).
	// This is useful in any case where some "set" of providers can be captured by a single implementation that may
	// power fundamentally different schemata -- dynamically bridging Terraform providers, or managing Kubernetes
	// clusters with custom resource definitions, for instance, are good examples. The parameterized package that

	// * *Replacement parameterization*, whereby a `Parameterize` call results in a schema that completely replaces the
	//   original provider schema. Bridging a Terraform provider dynamically might be an example of this -- following
	//   the call to `Parameterize`, the provider's schema will become that of the Terraform provider that was bridged.
	//   Providers that implement replacement parameterization expect a *single* call to `Parameterize`.

	// * *Extension parameterization*, in which a `Parameterize` call results in a schema that is a superset of the
	//   original. This is useful in cases where a provider can be extended with additional resources or functions, such
	//   as a Kubernetes provider that can be extended with resources representing custom resource definitions.
	//   Providers that implement extension parameterization should accept multiple calls to `Parameterize`. Extension
	//   packages may even be called multiple times with the same package name, but with different versions. The CRUD
	//   operations of extension resources must include the version of which sub-package they correspond to.
