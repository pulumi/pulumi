// it's 'dependencies' section to determine what packages should be included.
//
// During this walk, if a package is encountered that contains a `"pulumi": { ... }` section then
// the normal `"dependencies": { ... }` section of that package will not be included.  These are
// "pulumi" packages, and those dependencies are only intended for use at deployment time. However,
// a "pulumi" package can also specify package that should be available at cloud-runtime.  These
// packages are found in a `"runtimeDependencies": { ... }` section in the package.json file with
// the same format as the normal "dependencies" section.
//
// See [CodePathOptions] for information on ways to control and configure the final set of paths
// included in the resultant asset/archive map.
//
// Note: this functionality is specifically intended for use by downstream library code that is
// determining what is needed for a cloud-lambda.  i.e. the aws.serverless.Function or
// azure.serverless.FunctionApp libraries.  In general, other clients should not need to use this
// helper.
