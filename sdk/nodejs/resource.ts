     * code to dependOn a ComponentResource and have that effectively mean that it is depending on
     * all the CustomResource children of that component.
     *
     * Important!  We only walk through ComponentResources.  They're the only resources that serve
     * as an aggregation of other primitive (i.e. custom) resources.  While a custom resource can be
     * a parent of other resources, we don't want to ever depend on those child resource.  If we do,
     * it's simple to end up in a situation where we end up depending on a child resource that has a
     * data cycle dependency due to the data passed into it.
     *
     * An example of how this would be bad is:
     *
     * ```ts
     *     var c1 = new CustomResource("c1");
     *     var c2 = new CustomResource("c2", { parentId: c1.id }, { parent: c1 });
     *     var c3 = new CustomResource("c3", { parentId: c1.id }, { parent: c1 });
     * ```
     *
     * The problem here is that 'c2' has a data dependency on 'c1'.  If it tries to wait on 'c1' it
     * will walk to the children and wait on them.  This will mean it will wait on 'c3'.  But 'c3'
     * will be waiting in the same manner on 'c2', and a cycle forms.
     *
     * This normally does not happen with ComponentResources as they do not have any data flowing
     * into them. The only way you would be able to have a problem is if you had this sort of coding
     * pattern:
     *
     * ```ts
     *     var c1 = new ComponentResource("c1");
     *     var c2 = new CustomResource("c2", { parentId: c1.urn }, { parent: c1 });
     *     var c3 = new CustomResource("c3", { parentId: c1.urn }, { parent: c1 });
     * ```
     *
     * However, this would be pretty nonsensical as there is zero need for a custom resource to ever
     * need to reference the urn of a component resource.  So it's acceptable if that sort of
     * pattern failed in practice.
