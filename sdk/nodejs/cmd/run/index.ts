// The very first thing we do is set up unhandled exception and rejection hooks to ensure that these
// events cause us to exit with a non-zero code. It is critically important that we do this early:
// if we do not, unhandled rejections in particular may cause us to exit with a 0 exit code, which
// will trick the engine into thinking that the program ran successfully. This can cause the engine
// to decide to delete all of a stack's resources.
//
// We track all uncaught errors here.  If we have any, we will make sure we always have a non-0 exit
// code.
const uncaughtErrors = new Set<Error>();

// We also track errors we know were logged to the user using our standard `log.error` call from
// inside our uncaught-error-handler in run.ts.  If all uncaught-errors above were also known to all
// be logged properly to the user, then we know the user has the information they need to proceed.
// We can then report the langhost that it should just stop running immediately and not print any
// additional superfluous information.
const loggedErrors = new Set<Error>();

let programRunning = false;

    uncaughtErrors.add(err);
    if (!programRunning) {
        console.error(err.stack || err.message);
    }
};

// Keep track if we already logged the information about an unhandled error to the user..  If
// so, we end with a different exit code.  The language host recognizes this and will not print
// any further messages to the user since we already took care of it.
//
// 32 was picked so as to be very unlikely to collide with any of the error codes documented by
// nodejs here:
// https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/blob/master/doc/api/process.markdown#exit-codes
export const nodeJSProcessExitedAfterLoggingUserActionableMessage = 32;

process.on("exit", (code: number) => {

    // If there were any uncaught errors at all, we always want to exit with an error code. If we
    // did not, it could be disastrous for the user.  i.e. not all resources may have been created,
    // but the 0 code would indicate we could proceed.  That could lead to many (or all) of the
    // user resources being deleted.
    if (code === 0 && uncaughtErrors.size > 0) {
        // Now Check if this error was already logged to the user in a visible fashion.  If not

// As the second thing we do, ensure that we're connected to v8's inspector API.  We need to do
// this as some information is only sent out as events, without any way to query for it after the
// fact.  For example, we want to keep track of ScriptId->FileNames so that we can appropriately
// report errors for Functions we cannot serialize.  This can only be done (up to Node11 at least)
// by register to hear about scripts being parsed.
