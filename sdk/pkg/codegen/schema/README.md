# Pulumi Schema

This package defines [Pulumi
Schema](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/guides/pulumi-packages/schema/), a
language-neutral specification for cloud resource models. Pulumi Schema is the
interface definition language for all Pulumi Packages, and is used as the input
to SDK code generation for each supported Pulumi language.
