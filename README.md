# Pulumi

Pulumi is a cloud development platform that makes creating cloud programs easy and productive.

Author cloud programs in your favorite favorite language and Pulumi will automatically keep your
infrastructure up-to-date.  Skip learning yet another YAML dialect.  Pulumi is multi-language and
multi-cloud, and fully extensible.

To install the latest Pulumi release, run:

```bash
$ curl -fsSL https://get.pulumi.com/ | sh
```

If you are learning about Pulumi for the first time, please [visit the project website](https://pulumi.io/).

This repo contains the CLI, language SDKs, and the core Pulumi engine.  Individual libraries are in their own repos.

## Examples

A collection of examples for different languages, clouds, and scenarios is available in the
[pulumi/examples](https://github.com/pulumi/examples) repo.

## Development

If you'd like to contribute to Pulumi and/or build from source, this section is for you.

### Prerequisites

Pulumi is written in Go, uses Dep for dependency management, and GoMetaLinter for linting:

* [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install): https://golang.org/dl
* [Dep](https://github.com/golang/dep): `$ go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep`
* [GoMetaLinter](https://github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter):
    - `$ go get -u github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter`
    - `$ gometalinter --install`

### Building from Source

To install the pre-built SDK, please run `curl -fsSL https://get.pulumi.com/ | sh`, or see detailed installation
instructions on [the project page](https://pulumi.io/).  Read on if you want to install from source.

To build the Pulumi CLI from source, you may simply run:

    $ go get -u github.com/pulumi/pulumi

This installs the `pulumi` binary to `$GOPATH/bin`.

To do anything interesting with Pulumi, you will need an SDK for your language of choice.  The SDK installation comes
with pre-built language providers, however the `make` flow below will create a complete SDK distribution for you.

### Building and Testing

To build a complete Pulumi SDK, ensure `$GOPATH` is set, and clone into a standard Go workspace:

    $ git clone git@github.com:pulumi/pulumi $GOPATH/src/github.com/pulumi/pulumi
    $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/pulumi/pulumi

The first time you build, you must `make ensure` to install dependencies and perform other machine setup:

    $ make ensure

In the future, you can synch dependencies simply by running `dep ensure` explicitly:

    $ dep ensure

At this point you can run `make` to build and run tests:

    $ make

This installs the `pulumi` binary into `$GOPATH/bin`, which may now be run provided `make` exited successfully.

The Makefile also supports just running tests (`make test_all` or `make test_fast`), just running the linter
(`make lint`), just running Govet (`make vet`), and so on.  Please just refer to the Makefile for the full list of targets.

### Debugging

The Pulumi tools have extensive logging built in.  In fact, we encourage liberal logging in new code, and adding new
logging when debugging problems.  This helps to ensure future debugging endeavors benefit from your sleuthing.

All logging is done using Google's [Glog library](https://github.com/golang/glog).  It is relatively bare-bones, and
adds basic leveled logging, stack dumping, and other capabilities beyond what Go's built-in logging routines offer.

The `pulumi` command line has two flags that control this logging and that can come in handy when debugging problems.
The `--logtostderr` flag spews directly to stderr, rather than the default of logging to files in your temp directory.
And the `--verbose=n` flag (`-v=n` for short) sets the logging level to `n`.  Anything greater than 3 is reserved for
debug-level logging, greater than 5 is going to be quite verbose, and anything beyond 7 is extremely noisy.

For example, the command

    $ pulumi preview --logtostderr -v=5

is a pretty standard starting point during debugging that will show a fairly comprehensive trace log of a compilation.
