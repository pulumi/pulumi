# Pulumi Fabric

The Pulumi Fabric ("Pulumi") is a framework and toolset for creating reusable cloud services.

If you are learning about Pulumi for the first time, please [visit our docs website](https://docs.pulumi.com/).

## Build Status

| Architecture | Build Status |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Linux x64    | [![Linux x64 Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/pulumi/pulumi.svg?token=cTUUEgrxaTEGyecqJpDn&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/pulumi/pulumi)  |

## Installing

To install Pulumi from source, simply run:

    $ go get -u github.com/pulumi/pulumi

A `GOPATH` must be set.  A good default value is `~/go`.  In fact, [this is the default in Go 1.8](
https://github.com/golang/go/issues/17262).

This installs the `pulumi` binary to `$GOPATH/bin`.

To do anything interesting with Pulumi, you will need an SDK for your language of choice.  Please see
[sdk/README.md](`sdk/`) for information about how to obtain, install, and use such an SDK.

## Development

This section is for Pulumi developers.

### Prerequisites

Pulumi is written in Go, uses Dep for dependency management, and GoMetaLinter for linting:

* [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install): https://golang.org/dl
* [Dep](https://github.com/golang/dep): `$ go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep`
* [GoMetaLinter](https://github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter):
    - `$ go get -u github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter`
    - `$ gometalinter --install`

### Building and Testing

To build Pulumi, ensure `$GOPATH` is set, and clone into a standard Go workspace:

    $ git clone git@github.com:pulumi/pulumi $GOPATH/src/github.com/pulumi/pulumi
    $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/pulumi/pulumi

The first time you build, you must `make ensure` to install dependencies and perform other machine setup:

    $ make ensure

In the future, you can synch dependencies simply by running `dep ensure` explicitly:

    $ dep ensure

At this point you can run `make` to build and run tests:

    $ make

This installs the `pulumi` binary into `$GOPATH/bin`, which may now be run provided `make` exited successfully.

The Makefile also supports just running tests (`make test_all` or `make test_fast`), just running the linter
(`make lint`), just running Govet (`make vet`), and so on.  Please just refer to the Makefile for the full list of targets.

### Debugging

The Pulumi tools have extensive logging built in.  In fact, we encourage liberal logging in new code, and adding new
logging when debugging problems.  This helps to ensure future debugging endeavors benefit from your sleuthing.

All logging is done using Google's [Glog library](https://github.com/golang/glog).  It is relatively bare-bones, and
adds basic leveled logging, stack dumping, and other capabilities beyond what Go's built-in logging routines offer.

The `pulumi` command line has two flags that control this logging and that can come in handy when debugging problems.
The `--logtostderr` flag spews directly to stderr, rather than the default of logging to files in your temp directory.
And the `--verbose=n` flag (`-v=n` for short) sets the logging level to `n`.  Anything greater than 3 is reserved for
debug-level logging, greater than 5 is going to be quite verbose, and anything beyond 7 is extremely noisy.

For example, the command

    $ pulumi eval --logtostderr -v=5

is a pretty standard starting point during debugging that will show a fairly comprehensive trace log of a compilation.
