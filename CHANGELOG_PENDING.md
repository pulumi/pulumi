### Improvements

- [cli] - Implement `pulumi stack unselect`.
  [#9179](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/pull/9179)

- [language/dotnet] - Updated Pulumi dotnet packages to use grpc-dotnet instead of grpc.
  [#9149](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/pull/9149)

- [cli/config] - Rename the `config` property in `Pulumi.yaml` to `stackConfigDir`. The `config` key will continue to be supported.
  [#9145](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/pull/9145)

- [cli/plugins] Add support for downloading plugin from private Pulumi GitHub releases. This also drops the use of the `GITHUB_ACTOR` and `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variables for authenticating to github. Only `GITHUB_TOKEN` is now used, but this can be set to a personal access token.
  [#9185](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/pull/9185)

- [cli] - Speed up `pulumi stack --show-name` by skipping unneeded snapshot loading.
  [#9199](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/pull/9199)

- [cli/plugins] - Improved error message for missing plugins.
  [#5208](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/pull/5208)

- [sdk/nodejs] - Take engines property into account when engine-strict appear in npmrc file
  [#9249](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/pull/9249)

### Bug Fixes

- [cli/engine] - Stops storing aliases in state due to the impact on file size and upload time. Due
  to [#8627](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/pull/8627), the number of aliases stored in state
  increases combinatorially with the number of type aliases of a resource and of each of its
  ancestors. [#9089](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/issues/9089)

- [sdk/nodejs] - Fix uncaught error "ENOENT: no such file or directory" when an error occurs during the stack up.
  [#9065](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/issues/9065)

- [sdk/nodejs] - Fix uncaught error "ENOENT: no such file or directory" when an error occurs during the stack preview.
  [#9272](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/issues/9272)

- [sdk/go] - Fix a panic in `pulumi.All` when using pointer inputs.
  [#9197](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/issues/9197)

- [cli/engine] - Fix a panic due to passing `""` as the ID for a resource read.
  [#9243](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/pull/9243)

- [cli/engine] - Fix a panic due to `Check` failing while using update plans.
