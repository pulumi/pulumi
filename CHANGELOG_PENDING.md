### Improvements

- [cli] - Fix the preview experience for unconfigured providers. Rather than returning the
  inputs of a resource managed by an unconfigured provider as its outputs, the engine will treat all outputs as unknown. Most
  programs will not be affected by these changes: in general, the only programs that will
  see differences are programs that:

      1. pass unknown values to provider instances
      2. use these provider instances to manage resources
      3. pass values from these resources to resources that are managed by other providers

  These kinds of programs are most common in scenarios that deploy managed Kubernetes
  clusters and Kubernetes apps within the same program, then flow values from those apps
  into other resources.

  The legacy behavior can be re-enabled by setting the `PULUMI_LEGACY_PROVIDER_PREVIEW` to
  a truthy value (e.g. `1`, `true`, etc.).
