### Breaking Changes

- We documented a breaking change for 3.0 for stack selection behavior (see https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/migrating-3.0/#updated-cli-behavior-in-pulumi-30). Unfortunately, the initial release did not include that change. 
  We apologize for any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused and have now correctly added that behavior.
  [#6840](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/pull/6840)

- [cli] Set pagination defaults for `pulumi stack history` to 10 entries.
  This change was originally intended for the 3.0 release but was unfortunately left out of the initial release.
  We apologize for any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused and have now correctly added the behavior.
