# Contributing to Lumi

Do you want to hack on Lumi?  Awesome!  We are so happy to have you.

This document outlines the process of contributing and the expectations and requirements of you as a contributor and
important member of the Lumi community.

## Pull Requests Welcome

First and foremost: We welcome any and all contributions from any and all contributors.  Please do not hesitate to ask
a question, make a suggestion, fix a bug, or implement a feature, no matter how big or small.

We of course would like such contributions to follow these guidelines and will most likely want the opportunity to
discuss the proposed design of major contributions before you spend considerable time creating them.  For that, reason,
we recommend engaging early and often with the core community contributors.

## Contribution Requirements

In order to ensure contributions go through smoothly, please follow these guidelines.

### Licenses and Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

We'd love to jump straight into the code.  Before we can do that, we have to talk about licenses for a moment.

Licensing is very important because it helps ensure the software continues to be available under the terms the author
desired. The license tells you what rights you have that are provided by the copyright holder.  It's important that the
contributor fully understands what rights they are licensing and agrees to them.  Sometimes the copyright holder isn't
the contributor, such as when the contributor is doing the work on behalf of a company.

To ensure these criteria are met, contributions to Lumi must follow the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) process.

The DCO is an attestation attached to every contribution made by every developer.  In the commit message of the
contribution, you will simply add a Signed-off-by statement, which indicates that you agree to the DCO:

    Signed-off-by: Hinakuluiau Lie <hina@pulumi.com>

The easiest way to perform this sign-off is with the `-s` option to `git commit` (long form `--signoff`).

You may find a copy of the DCO at http://developercertificate.org/ or below for convenience:

```
Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the
    best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open
    source license and I have the right under that license to
    submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole
    or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless
    I am permitted to submit under a different license), as
    Indicated in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including
    all personal information I submit with it, including my
    sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed
    consistent with this project or the open source license(s)
    involved.
```

### Coding Standards

In general, our rule is to use the best in breed coding standards for the respective language.  Lumi is a multi-language
ecosystem and so the rules here differ based on which language a particular contribution is written in.  There are also
some language-agnostic rules that we follow.  Let's look at each in order.

#### Language-Specific Coding Standards

Because Lumi is multi-language, the coding standards that apply to your contribution will depend on where you are making
that contribution.  Here are the current relevant language standards.

##### Go

All Go code MUST:

* Be [`gofmt` clean](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/).
* Be [`golint` clean](https://github.com/golang/lint).
* Be [`go vet` clean](https://golang.org/cmd/vet/).
* Follow the [Effective Go best practices](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html).

##### TypeScript

All TypeScript code MUST:

* Be [`tslint` clean](https://github.com/palantir/tslint).
* Follow the [TypeScript team's coding guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Coding-guidelines).

##### JavaScript

All JavaScript code MUST:

* Follow the [Google JavaScript style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html).

##### Python

All Python code MUST:

* Follow the [Google Python style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).

#### Language-Agnostic Coding Standards

These are some language-agnostic rules we apply across our codebase:

* The top of each file MUST contain the standard Lumi licensing information:

    ```
    // Copyright 2016-2017, Pulumi Corporation.  All rights reserved.
    ```

* There are three special kinds of comments; two MUST have a corresponding work item `xx`, while the other MAY:

    - `TODO[pulumi/lumi#xx]: <comment>`: a known loose end for the future: MUST have a work item.
    - `BUG[pulumi/lumi#xx]: <comment>`: knowingly incorrect code: use sparingly, MUST have a work item!
    - `IDEA[pulumi/lumi(#xx)]: <comment>`: a lesser priority idea for improving the code: MAY have a work item.

* All code SHOULD use defensive coding where applicable, such as liberal assertions and contracts.

* All code SHOULD use logging extensively to facilitate future debugging endeavors.

## How to Contribute

### Developer Guide

We do not yet have a developer guide, though that's on the [TODO[pulumi/lumi#166]](
https://github.com/pulumi/lumi/issues/166) list.  For now, please refer to our [README](
https://github.com/pulumi/lumi/blob/master/README.md), as it has rudimentary instructions on enlisting, building, and
testing, plus links to the relevant tidbits throughout the repo that you might be interested in.

### Filing Issues

If you have a question about Lumi, or have a problem using it, please start with our troubleshooting guide.  (OK, OK, we
don't yet have a troubleshooting guide... someday.)  If that doesn't answer your questions, or if you think you found a
bug, please [file an issue](https://github.com/pulumi/lumi/issues/new).  We are happy to help!

### Finding Things that Need Help

If you're new to the project and want to help, but don't know where to start, we do classify certain issues as "job
jar" to indicate that they are fairly bite-sized, independent, and shouldn't require deep knowledge of the system.
[Please have a look and see if anything sounds interesting!](
https://github.com/pulumi/lumi/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Astatus%2Fjob-jar)

Alternatively, you may want to peruse the [many design documents](/docs), and see if something piques your interest.
The best way to learn is to hack, so please feel free to experiment!  There is always code that can be clarified, better
documented, tested with more rigor, or improved with clearer names, all of which would be much appreciated.

### Submitting a Pull Request

If you are working on an existing work item, please be sure to let people know.  Alternatively, if you are doing work
to fix something or make an improvement for which there isn't yet a work item, please file one first, so that we have
record of the issue in advance and can comment on relevant history and/or collaborate with you on the design.

We follow the usual Git flow for contributions, so just fork the repo, develop and test your changes, and, once it is
passing all relevant tests, then submit a pull request.

Please follow these guidelines for your pull request (PR):

* PRs MUST be related to one piece of work, not a smattering of unrelated changes.
* PRs MUST have short, but descriptive, names.
* PRs MUST have informative descriptions that link to the relevant work item for the work.
* PRs MUST tag at least one desired reviewer for the change.  If you are unsure, ask in the relevant work item.
* Any and all PR feedback MUST be addressed to the satisfaction of the project maintainers.
* PRs SHOULD squash superfluous commits but retain the essential ones.

And, with that, we're done.  We sincerely look forward to seeing the amazing Lumi contributions you will make!
