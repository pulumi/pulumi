// The ResourceProvider service defines a standard interface for [resource providers](providers). A resource provider

    // behaviour at a high level (e.g. by specifying the region in which an AWS provider should operate), a
    // `Parameterize` call may change the set of resources and functions that a provider offers (that is, its schema).
    // This is useful in any case where some "set" of providers can be captured by a single implementation that may
    // power fundamentally different schemata -- dynamically bridging Terraform providers, or managing Kubernetes
    // clusters with custom resource definitions, for instance, are good examples. The parameterized package that

    // * *Replacement parameterization*, whereby a `Parameterize` call results in a schema that completely replaces the
    //   original provider schema. Bridging a Terraform provider dynamically might be an example of this -- following
    //   the call to `Parameterize`, the provider's schema will become that of the Terraform provider that was bridged.
    //   Providers that implement replacement parameterization expect a *single* call to `Parameterize`.
    //
    // * *Extension parameterization*, in which a `Parameterize` call results in a schema that is a superset of the
    //   original. This is useful in cases where a provider can be extended with additional resources or functions, such
    //   as a Kubernetes provider that can be extended with resources representing custom resource definitions.
    //   Providers that implement extension parameterization should accept multiple calls to `Parameterize`. Extension
    //   packages may even be called multiple times with the same package name, but with different versions. The CRUD
    //   operations of extension resources must include the version of which sub-package they correspond to.
    //
    // `Parameterize` should work the same whether it is provided with `ParametersArgs` or `ParametersValue` input. In
