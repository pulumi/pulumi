# Now, perform the publish. The logic here is a little goofy because npm provides
# no way to say "if the package already exists, don't fail" but we want these
# semantics (so, for example, we can restart builds which may have failed after
# publishing, or so two builds can run concurrently, which is the case for when we
# tag master right after pushing a new commit and the push and tag travis jobs both
# get the same version.
#
# We exploit the fact that `npm info <package-name>@<package-version>` has no output
# when the package does not exist.
